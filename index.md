## Projects I Am Proud Of
- [Sudoku](https://github.com/JesseTWolf/Sudoku2.0)
  - A Sudoku game created in Java. Uses a psuedo random grid generation I designed to generate a new grid each game. Included a [jar](https://github.com/JesseTWolf/Sudoku2.0/blob/master/Sudoku%202.0.jar) for ease of use. 
- Quite a few others in work, however they are not ready for view as of yet or are connected to previous quarters' classwork and being kept private for now.
